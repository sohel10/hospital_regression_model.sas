Medicare Hospital Cost Modeling Using SAS
Developed a predictive model using publicly available CMS Provider-Specific File (PSF) data to analyze how hospital characteristics
influence Medicare-adjusted cost per inpatient discharge. Implemented generalized linear modeling in SAS Studio to evaluate the effect 
of case mix index, teaching intensity, hospital efficiency, and value-based purchasing adjustments. Generated reproducible statistical 
output using ODS and exported results for stakeholder interpretation. This independent project demonstrates practical SAS programming 
skills and health policy modeling expertise.

Key methods & tools:

PROC GLM, PROC MEANS, ODS HTML in SAS

Derived variables (e.g., teaching indicator from interns-to-beds ratio)

Model interpretation (effect sizes, p-values, fit metrics)

Public data source: CMS Inpatient PSF (April 2025)

Highlights:

Built transparent, documented code in SAS

Produced downloadable HTML/PDF summary output

Structured for private GitHub sharing with recruiters or hiring teams
